# Google-Calendar-API-Text-Alert
This is a simple Python script that pulls all the events on my Google Calendar for that day then texts them to me. I deployed this as a Google Cloud Function and set it up on a Google Cloud Scheduler so each morning at 7am it runs my script and texts me my daily calendar events so I wake up to a text telling me what I have planned for the day.
